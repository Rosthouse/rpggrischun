Hello fellow traveller

## How to work with this

It depends on if you want to be a developer or an editor. 

## Install

### Editor

I'd recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I've also included a workspace config with recommended plugins, so you should be able to start basically immediatly.

### Git client


## As an Editor

You may be able to completely forgoe any editor, as you can directly edit Markdown files in Github itself. Try it out.

Otherwise, I'd suggest getting the same tools as the developers. Don't worry, you will only edit Markdown files, which are very easy.
